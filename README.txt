Opening page with a map of NYC - very graphic (we may need a graphic designer) where there are icons to click on for each neighborhood.  ( this can be a 2 dimensional map with dots like image here or 3 d like hudson yards)
Opening page must have a description of the project



Each big dot is a neighborhood.
The neighborhoods that I am including are:
Brooklyn
Soho
Tribeca
West Village
Village
Chelsea
Nomad
Upper West Side
Upper East Side
Bronx
More may be added eventually. 

The dot instead of being a bit of color is a detail of a photograph from the specific neighborhood.
When you click on that icon, you see that photograph larger and the text about that neighborhood.

Once you get into the neighborhood, that opens the door to several more pictures within the neighborhood.
Each picture within the neighborhood has text associated with it that is the imagined story of the neighborhood - this fictional text should scroll over the picture and after the view scrolls can they zoom in and see more detail in the photograph?  (some of these are recorded as audio, can there be a button to hear the audio)
-Once the fictional text has scrolled down and the viewer has read that - could there be a button to get the factual text - the caption?
